// Use this file to specify which users are administrators on your server.
//
// There are 2 ways to assign administrators, the first way being assigning
// them individually and the second being assigning them to a group.
//
// For both ways, you need to add the user's Steam ID 64 as the key. You can
// obtain this information from the user directly if he's familiar with it or
// you can use websites such as "https://steamid.io/lookup"
//
// If you add the user individually, you need to set the "flags" with the
// permission(s) you want to assign and an "immunity" field for his immunity
// level. Both the "flags" and "immunity" fields are detailed below:
//
// Flags
//   a - Slot reservation - can join the server even if it's full (the last
//   connected client is kicked automatically).
//   b - Basic admin. - recognized as an administrator.
//   c - Kick - can kick clients.
//   d - Ban - can ban clients.
//   e - Ban removal - can remove client bans.
//   f - Slay - can slay clients.
//   g - Map change - can change the current map.
//   h - CVAR - can change console variables (!!Be careful to who you assign
//   this!!)
//   i - Custom 1 - custom permission number 1 for Angelscript plugins.
//   j - Admin. chat - can use the private admin. chat.
//   k - Vote - can issue generic/custom votes.
//   l - Custom 2 - custom permission number 2 for Angelscript plugins.
//   m - RCON - can use the Remote CONtrol feature from Source engine (!!Be
//   careful to who you assign this!!)
//   n - Custom 3 - custom permission number 3 for Angelscript plugins.
//   o - Custom 4 - custom permission number 4 for Angelscript plugins.
//   p - Custom 5 - custom permission number 5 for Angelscript plugins.
//   q - Custom 6 - custom permission number 6 for Angelscript plugins.
//   r - Custom 7 - custom permission number 7 for Angelscript plugins.
//   s - Custom 8 - custom permission number 8 for Angelscript plugins.
//   t - Custom 9 - custom permission number 9 for Angelscript plugins.
//   u - Custom 10 - custom permission number 10 for Angelscript plugins.
//   v - Custom 11 - custom permission number 11 for Angelscript plugins.
//   w - Custom 12 - custom permission number 12 for Angelscript plugins.
//   x - Custom 13 - custom permission number 13 for Angelscript plugins.
//   y - Custom 14 - custom permission number 14 for Angelscript plugins.
//   z - Root - super-administrator, all permissions above with immunity (!!Be
//   careful to who you assign this!!)
//
// Immunity
//   By default, if the immunity is higher than another group and/or person,
//   that group/player can't be targeted by those with lower immunity.
//   If the immunity is equal, they will be able to target each other if the
//   server uses the alternate targeting method.
//   Groups/persons that have the "root" privilege can't be targeted regardless
//   of the immunity value.
//
// The second way consists of setting up the group in the "groups" section and
// reference that group's name in the "group" field of the user.
//
// If you have more than one user/group, remember to add a colon (,) at the end
// of every object except the last one.
//
// Below are examples of various setups that you can base yourself upon.
